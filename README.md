# Intro

This project was started during the [#VersusVirus](https://www.versusvirus.ch/)
Hackathon in April 2020. The goal was to give a first impression how an online parliament could look and feel like. After beeing recognised as highlightes project we continued work during [#theGlobalHack](https://theglobalhack.com/) where we won the governance track. Thereafter we received a funding grant from #VersusVirus and are now working on implementing an awesome MVP.

This Video explains what we're doing in detail :)

## What are we trying to achieve?

We want to give parliaments the possibility to meet and vote on their business online. Digitalisation on the fast track, from physical being under one roof to simply doing the same work in a safe virtual space. Politicians need to lead by example, staying at home is the first crucial step!
